# Peer Review Log

## 2026-05-25 02:00 KST - Review 1

### Scope

- Main portfolio copy and layout entry points
- Routing/navigation behavior
- Build and package-management health
- Shared UI components with obvious code-level risk

### Findings

1. `components/GalleryBox.tsx` imports `useRouter` from `next/router`, but this App Router project should avoid `next/router`.
   - Current impact: unused import only, so runtime impact is low.
   - Recommended action: remove the import. If routing is needed later, use `next/navigation`.

2. `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx` renders every work card with `Link href="/"`.
   - Current impact: portfolio items cannot lead to detail pages or external project links.
   - Recommended action: add a `href` field to each work item and route to a real detail page or project URL.

3. `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx` uses duplicate `text` values as React keys.
   - Current impact: repeated `"yummy yummy"` keys can cause unstable reconciliation once the list changes.
   - Recommended action: add a stable `id` field to work items and use it as the key.

4. `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` both exist, but `package-lock.json` is not in sync with `package.json`.
   - Current impact: `npm ci` fails, while Yarn install works.
   - Recommended action: choose one package manager. Given current state, keep Yarn and remove or regenerate `package-lock.json`.

5. Production build fails on this Windows environment with Node 20.12.2 due to a Next worker memory crash.
   - Verified: `corepack yarn lint` passes with warnings only, and `tsc --noEmit` passes.
   - Current impact: deploy/build pipeline may fail depending on environment memory and worker behavior.
   - Recommended action: reproduce on CI or WSL/Linux, then consider reducing worker pressure, upgrading Next, or isolating large image/static processing paths.

6. Several components contain unused imports or state setters.
   - Examples: `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx` has state setters that are never used, and other components have historical imports.
   - Current impact: noise during maintenance and harder code review.
   - Recommended action: run cleanup after the current content pass, keeping behavior unchanged.

### Verification

- `corepack yarn lint`: passed with existing `<img>` warnings in `components/Footer.tsx`.
- `node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`: passed.
- `corepack yarn build`: failed with `Fatal process out of memory: Zone` from Next/Jest worker.

### Next Review Angle

- Review responsive layout risks after Korean copy expansion.
- Check About/Work pages for content consistency with AI developer positioning.
- Identify low-risk cleanup commits that can be separated from visual/content changes.

## 2026-05-25 03:00 KST - Review 2

### Scope

- Korean portfolio copy quality after AI developer positioning change
- Encoding safety for Korean source text
- Verification-oriented portfolio narrative
- Fast syntax-level validation after copy changes

### Findings

1. The first AI developer copy was too generic and sounded like "AI로 빠르게 만든다" rather than "AI 결과를 책임 있게 검증한다."
   - Current impact: the portfolio positioning did not clearly differentiate the developer's strength.
   - Action taken: revised the main copy toward evaluation, evidence, failure detection, repeatable validation, and reliability automation.

2. Korean text in source files is vulnerable to mojibake during shell-based edits.
   - Current impact: previous Korean copy became unreadable in `app/layout.tsx`, `components/main/MainWrapper.tsx`, and `components/Footer.tsx`.
   - Action taken: rewrote the affected copy blocks and re-saved touched files as UTF-8.
   - Action taken: added an `.editorconfig` with `charset = utf-8` and LF line endings.
   - Recommended action: avoid ad hoc shell text replacement for Korean copy.

3. The homepage now has a stronger technical narrative, but the About and Work pages still use older generic AI/developer wording.
   - Current impact: users may see a strong verification-focused homepage, then inconsistent supporting pages.
   - Recommended action: update `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx` and `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx` around the same "검증하는 AI 개발자" positioning.

4. The build toolchain still has intermittent Node/V8 `Zone` memory failures on Windows.
   - Current impact: `next lint` and `next build` are not reliable gates in this local environment.
   - Recommended action: verify in a clean Linux/CI environment or WSL, then decide whether this is environment-specific or a Next/SWC dependency issue.

### Verification

- `node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`: passed.
- Mojibake marker search for known broken Korean byte patterns: no matches in `app`, `components`, or `PEER_REVIEW.md`.
- `corepack yarn lint`: failed this run with Node/V8 `Fatal process out of memory: Zone`.
- `corepack yarn build`: failed this run with Node/V8 `Fatal process out of memory: Zone`.

### Next Review Angle

- Make About/Work pages support the new verification-focused positioning.
- Add encoding/tooling guardrails so Korean content edits do not regress.
- Separate visual copy changes from code cleanup in future commits.

## 2026-05-25 04:00 KST - Review 3

### Scope

- Work page data modeling and navigation
- App Router compatibility in shared gallery/navigation components
- Ref safety around scroll-driven layout code
- Documentation integrity after Korean encoding issues

### Findings

1. `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx:107` still routes every work card to `/`.
   - Current impact: the Work page looks clickable but cannot expose project detail, case-study, or external result pages.
   - Recommended action: model each work item as `{ id, title, href, images }` and render `Link href={work.href}`. If a project has no target yet, make that explicit in the data instead of silently linking home.

2. `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx:64` keeps work data inside the component and uses duplicate titles as identity.
   - Current impact: the UI, routing, and data are coupled; duplicate `"yummy yummy"` labels make React keys unstable and prevent reliable project expansion.
   - Recommended action: extract a typed `works` array near the module top or under `config/works.ts`, with stable `id` values and project metadata.

3. `components/GalleryBox.tsx:1` imports `useRouter` from `next/router`, and `components/GalleryBox.tsx:2` imports unused hooks.
   - Current impact: it works only because those imports are unused, but it leaves Pages Router API in an App Router codebase and adds review noise.
   - Recommended action: remove `useRouter`, `useEffect`, and `useState`; keep this component presentational.

4. `components/GalleryBox.tsx:33` through `components/GalleryBox.tsx:133` manually repeats the same `<span>{text}</span>` blocks.
   - Current impact: the component is long, harder to change, and easy to make inconsistent when the marquee behavior changes.
   - Recommended action: create a small helper like `renderLoopText(text, count = 10)` or map over `Array.from({ length: 10 })` for each edge.

5. `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:72` and `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx:47` dereference refs through `mainContainer.current` and `infoText.current` without guarding `.current`.
   - Current impact: React effects normally run after refs attach, but this can still crash under conditional rendering, test environments, or future layout changes.
   - Recommended action: use early guards such as `if (!mainContainer.current || !infoText.current) return;`.

6. `components/NaviBox.tsx:3`, `components/NaviBox.tsx:5`, `components/NaviBox.tsx:6`, `components/NaviBox.tsx:7`, and `components/NaviBox.tsx:23` show unused imports/state plumbing.
   - Current impact: `Link`, `useRef`, `useWindowSize`, `keyframes`, and `setRoute` increase maintenance noise and hide the actual navigation behavior.
   - Recommended action: remove unused imports and either wire `useCommonStore` to real behavior or delete it from this component.

7. `app/layout.tsx` had a mojibake-damaged metadata description during this review.
   - Current impact: the project could fail type checking or ship broken SEO text.
   - Action taken: restored `description` to readable Korean and kept `Noto Sans KR` metadata setup intact.
   - Recommended action: keep Korean copy changes in editor/patch workflows that preserve UTF-8.

### Verification

- `node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`: passed after restoring `app/layout.tsx`.
- Searched for known mojibake marker characters in `app`, `components`, and `PEER_REVIEW.md`: no matches after cleanup.
- `git status --short --branch`: showed a clean branch before this review and only review/layout documentation changes afterward.

### Next Review Angle

- Turn the Work page findings into a small data-model cleanup commit.
- Re-run lint in a stable Node environment and compare against the manual unused-import findings.
- Review image handling and asset sizes, especially large `public/images/img_user_*.jpg` files.

## 2026-05-25 05:00 KST - Review 4

### Scope

- Static image sizes and dimensions
- Image rendering strategy in homepage, About, Work, gallery, and footer
- Accessibility impact of CSS background images and icon images
- Next.js image optimization opportunities

### Findings

1. Several public images are much larger than their likely display size.
   - Evidence: `public/images/img_user_1.jpg` is 3543x3543 and 6.98 MB; `img_product_third.png` is 1228x1628 and 3.54 MB; `img_product_second.png` is 1150x1558 and 2.89 MB; `img_user_4.jpg` is 2456x1608 and 2.44 MB.
   - Current impact: About and homepage/gallery views can transfer multi-megabyte assets before the user sees meaningful content.
   - Recommended action: generate web-sized variants, preferably AVIF/WebP plus fallback, and keep originals outside `public` if they are not served directly.

2. Most important visual assets are rendered as CSS `background-image` rather than `next/image`.
   - Evidence: `components/main/MainWrapper.tsx:342`, `components/main/MainWrapper.tsx:538`, `components/main/MainWrapper.tsx:545`, `components/main/MainWrapper.tsx:553`, `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:263`, and `components/GalleryBox.tsx:229` use background images.
   - Current impact: the app misses built-in image optimization, responsive `srcset`, priority/lazy loading controls, and semantic `alt` text.
   - Recommended action: use `next/image` for content images. Keep CSS backgrounds only for purely decorative masks or texture-like art.

3. About page carousel user images are content but have no accessible name.
   - Evidence: `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:263` sets `backgroundImage` on `UserImgBox`.
   - Current impact: assistive technologies cannot understand what each slide represents, and browser image loading cannot be optimized per slide.
   - Recommended action: render an `Image` with `alt` derived from the project/member title and use CSS only for framing/cropping.

4. Footer icons use raw `<img>` tags and trigger the existing Next lint warning.
   - Evidence: `components/Footer.tsx:60`, `components/Footer.tsx:64`, and `components/Footer.tsx:68`.
   - Current impact: the project keeps known lint warnings and bypasses Next's image handling even for small icons.
   - Recommended action: switch to `next/image` for raster icons or inline SVG/import SVG icons where appropriate.

5. `next.config.mjs` does not define image-related policy.
   - Evidence: only the `styledComponents` compiler setting is configured.
   - Current impact: there is no explicit format/device-size strategy or documented image optimization policy.
   - Recommended action: once `next/image` is adopted, define `images.formats` such as `["image/avif", "image/webp"]` and ensure the device sizes match the portfolio layout breakpoints.

6. Large Work thumbnails are repeated across multiple cards.
   - Evidence: `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx` maps four cards to the same three `yummygame` images, each roughly 0.83 MB to 1.09 MB.
   - Current impact: caching helps after first load, but the page still has no real project diversity and can create duplicated decode/layout work.
   - Recommended action: pair the Review 3 work data-model cleanup with optimized per-project thumbnails.

7. Image dimensions are implicit in several components.
   - Evidence: gallery and product images rely on container aspect ratio/background cover rather than explicit image dimensions.
   - Current impact: layout stability depends on CSS containers and cannot benefit from image-level intrinsic sizing.
   - Recommended action: give image components stable dimensions or `fill` with a constrained parent `aspect-ratio`.

### Verification

- Enumerated image file sizes with `Get-ChildItem public/images -Recurse -File`.
- Read image dimensions via `System.Drawing.Image`.
- Searched usage with `rg -n "background-image|<img|next/image|img_user|img_product|main\\.jpeg|images/work|ico_" app components styles lib config`.
- `git status --short --branch`: clean before this review.

### Next Review Angle

- Review accessibility and keyboard interaction: navigation buttons, carousel arrows, external links, hover-only gallery behavior, and reduced-motion handling.
- Consider implementing the small unused-import cleanup from Reviews 1 and 3 before larger image refactors.

## 2026-05-25 06:00 KST - Review 5

### Scope

- Keyboard accessibility for navigation, gallery, carousel, and footer controls
- External link security and semantics
- Motion/reduced-motion handling
- Screen reader affordances for icon-only controls and decorative overlays

### Findings

1. The footer "top" control is a clickable `div`, not a button.
   - Evidence: `components/Footer.tsx:71` uses `<div className="top" onClick={...}>`.
   - Current impact: keyboard users cannot focus or activate the control reliably, and assistive tech does not receive button semantics.
   - Recommended action: change it to `<button type="button" className="top" aria-label="맨 위로 이동">` and keep the existing SVG visuals inside.

2. The mobile hamburger button has no accessible name.
   - Evidence: `components/NaviBox.tsx:34` renders a button with only two empty `<div>` bars.
   - Current impact: screen readers announce an unnamed button.
   - Recommended action: add `aria-label="메뉴 열기"` to the hamburger button and `aria-expanded={naviState}`.

3. The mobile menu dim/close button has no accessible name and the menu lacks dialog/navigation state.
   - Evidence: `components/NaviBox.tsx:48` renders a full-screen `.dim` button with no label.
   - Current impact: users may tab to an unnamed control; focus is not constrained while the menu is open.
   - Recommended action: add `aria-label="메뉴 닫기"`, wrap links in a semantic `nav`, and consider focus management for the open mobile menu.

4. Navigation uses buttons for route changes instead of links.
   - Evidence: `components/NaviBox.tsx:55`, `components/NaviBox.tsx:61`, and `components/NaviBox.tsx:69` call `router.push`.
   - Current impact: users cannot open routes in a new tab, copy link URLs, or get standard link semantics.
   - Recommended action: use `Link` for internal navigation and reserve `button` for actions that do not navigate.

5. External links opened with `target="_blank"` lack `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
   - Evidence: `components/Footer.tsx:58`, `components/Footer.tsx:63`, `components/Footer.tsx:67`, `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:359`, and `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:395`.
   - Current impact: opened pages can access `window.opener`, and audits will flag the links.
   - Recommended action: add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to every external blank-target link.

6. The About page has an anchor without `href`.
   - Evidence: `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:325` renders `<a>` around the Twitter row.
   - Current impact: it is not a real link, may not be keyboard-focusable as expected, and creates inconsistent social-link behavior.
   - Recommended action: either provide a real `href` or render it as a disabled/non-link element with clear semantics.

7. Carousel arrow buttons are icon-only without labels or disabled state.
   - Evidence: `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:154` and `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:196` render arrow buttons with SVG only.
   - Current impact: screen readers do not know what the controls do, and boundary conditions return `false` instead of communicating disabled state.
   - Recommended action: add `aria-label="이전 작업 보기"` / `aria-label="다음 작업 보기"` and use `disabled={currentMemberIdx === 1}` or `disabled={currentMemberIdx === memberArrayData.length}`.

8. The homepage gallery reveal is mouse-only.
   - Evidence: `components/main/MainWrapper.tsx:219` and `components/main/MainWrapper.tsx:220` rely on `onMouseEnter` / `onMouseLeave`.
   - Current impact: keyboard and touch users cannot trigger the same reveal interaction.
   - Recommended action: add `onFocus`, `onBlur`, and a semantic focusable control or link around the gallery.

9. The site has many continuous animations but no `prefers-reduced-motion` handling.
   - Evidence: `components/EffectBox.tsx:191`, `components/EffectBox.tsx:203`, `components/EffectBox.tsx:205`, `components/GalleryBox.tsx:277`, and `components/main/MainWrapper.tsx:580` animate overlays/marquees continuously.
   - Current impact: motion-sensitive users cannot opt out, and the UI may feel noisy during repeated visits.
   - Recommended action: add a global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rule that disables marquee/transition animations and uses static states.

10. Decorative transition overlays may be announced as content.
    - Evidence: `components/EffectBox.tsx` renders repeated rolling text and a fixed overlay without `aria-hidden`.
    - Current impact: screen readers may encounter repeated non-essential words while navigating pages.
    - Recommended action: mark the visual transition wrapper `aria-hidden="true"` unless it carries essential status information.

### Verification

- Searched interaction patterns with `rg -n "<button|<a|target=|onClick|onMouseEnter|onMouseLeave|hover|animation:|keyframes|scrollTo|aria-|role=|tabIndex|prefers-reduced-motion" app components styles lib`.
- Inspected `components/NaviBox.tsx`, `components/Footer.tsx`, and `components/EffectBox.tsx` directly.
- `node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`: passed after verifying the restored source files.
- Checked critical Korean strings via Python `unicode_escape` output because PowerShell display encoding renders Hangul as mojibake in this environment.

### Next Review Angle

- Review state management and client-component boundaries: unnecessary `"use client"` usage, Zustand store value, and direct DOM mutation patterns.
- Consider making the accessibility fixes in small commits because several are low-risk and user-facing.

## 2026-05-25 07:00 KST - Review 6

### Scope

- Client component boundaries and hydration cost
- Zustand store usage
- Direct DOM mutation patterns
- Scroll/window hooks and derived state
- Server/client split opportunities in the App Router structure

### Findings

1. `app/page.tsx` is marked `"use client"` even though it only returns `<MainWrapper />`.
   - Evidence: `app/page.tsx:1`.
   - Current impact: the route entrypoint is forced into the client boundary without local state or effects.
   - Recommended action: remove `"use client"` from `app/page.tsx`; keep client behavior inside `MainWrapper` where the hover state exists.

2. Layout wraps the whole app in a client smooth-scroll provider.
   - Evidence: `app/layout.tsx` renders `<SmoothScrolling>` around `StyledComponentsRegistry`, navigation, and all route children; `lib/smoothScrolling.tsx` is a client component using `ReactLenis`.
   - Current impact: every page goes through a client scroll provider even if a route does not need custom scroll behavior, increasing hydration surface and making native scroll semantics harder to reason about.
   - Recommended action: evaluate whether Lenis should be route-level or optional. If kept globally, document why and ensure accessibility/reduced-motion behavior is handled.

3. `lib/smoothScrolling.tsx` imports `useLenis` but never uses it.
   - Evidence: `lib/smoothScrolling.tsx:4`.
   - Current impact: small bundle/review noise and another example of stale code.
   - Recommended action: remove `useLenis` from the import.

4. `components/LeftWrapper.tsx` and `components/RightWrapper.tsx` are client components without client-only behavior.
   - Evidence: both files start with `"use client"` and only render styled wrappers.
   - Current impact: static layout wrappers become client components unnecessarily.
   - Recommended action: test whether the directive can be removed. If styled-components SSR requires a specific pattern, keep it documented; otherwise move them back to server-compatible components.

5. `components/NaviBox.tsx` reads from `useCommonStore` but does not use the value or call `setRoute`.
   - Evidence: `components/NaviBox.tsx:11` and `components/NaviBox.tsx:23`.
   - Current impact: Zustand is pulled into navigation for no behavior, and `stores/useCommon.ts` appears to be unused state infrastructure.
   - Recommended action: remove `useCommonStore` from `NaviBox` and delete the store if no other component uses it.

6. `stores/useCommon.ts` has an unused `get` argument and only stores route state that is already available through `usePathname`.
   - Evidence: `stores/useCommon.ts:8`.
   - Current impact: duplicated route state can drift from Next router state if it is revived later.
   - Recommended action: prefer `usePathname` for route reads. If global route state is needed, synchronize it explicitly in one place.

7. `components/EffectBox.tsx` stores props in state but never updates that state.
   - Evidence: `components/EffectBox.tsx:15` and `components/EffectBox.tsx:16`.
   - Current impact: `pageState` and `rollingTextState` are redundant and can become stale if props change.
   - Recommended action: use `text` and `rollingText` directly unless there is a planned transition state machine.

8. `components/EffectBox.tsx` imports `usePathname`, reads `windowHeight`, and defines `toggleAni`, but none of them affect rendering.
   - Evidence: `components/EffectBox.tsx:18`, `components/EffectBox.tsx:19`, and `components/EffectBox.tsx:96`.
   - Current impact: unnecessary subscriptions and dead code around a component that already animates heavily.
   - Recommended action: remove unused hook values and dead keyframes.

9. Several components mutate DOM styles through refs instead of representing transforms in React state/style.
   - Evidence: `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:75`, `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:80`, `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:87`, `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:90`, `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:93`, `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx:50`, `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx:55`, and `components/EffectBox.tsx:22`.
   - Current impact: behavior is harder to test, null-safety is weaker, and future concurrent rendering/layout changes are riskier.
   - Recommended action: compute transform strings and pass them via `style` props, or encapsulate imperative animation in a well-scoped hook with null guards.

10. `useWindowScroll` destructures `x: scrollX` in About and Work but `scrollX` is unused.
    - Evidence: `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx:67` and `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx:42`.
    - Current impact: minor noise; more importantly, it shows broad hook usage without a clear dependency budget.
    - Recommended action: destructure only `y: scrollY`.

### Verification

- Searched client/state patterns with `rg -n '"use client"|useState|useEffect|useRef|useWindow|usePathname|useRouter|useCommonStore|\\.current\\.style|document\\.|window\\.|setTimeout|ReactLenis|create\\(' app components lib stores styles config`.
- Inspected `app/layout.tsx`, `lib/smoothScrolling.tsx`, `lib/registry.tsx`, and `stores/useCommon.ts` directly.
- `node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`: passed.
- Checked UTF-8 integrity using a Python scan for CJK compatibility/han mojibake candidates in critical source and review files.

### Next Review Angle

- Review deployment/runtime configuration: `ecosystem.config.js`, scripts, Node version assumptions, package-manager consistency, and PM2 behavior.
- Consider implementing low-risk cleanup from this review: remove unused imports/state from `smoothScrolling`, `EffectBox`, `NaviBox`, and the route page.
