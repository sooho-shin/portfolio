# Peer Review Log

## 2026-05-25 02:00 KST - Review 1

### Scope

- Main portfolio copy and layout entry points
- Routing/navigation behavior
- Build and package-management health
- Shared UI components with obvious code-level risk

### Findings

1. `components/GalleryBox.tsx` imports `useRouter` from `next/router`, but this App Router project should avoid `next/router`.
   - Current impact: unused import only, so runtime impact is low.
   - Recommended action: remove the import. If routing is needed later, use `next/navigation`.

2. `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx` renders every work card with `Link href="/"`.
   - Current impact: portfolio items cannot lead to detail pages or external project links.
   - Recommended action: add a `href` field to each work item and route to a real detail page or project URL.

3. `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx` uses duplicate `text` values as React keys.
   - Current impact: repeated `"yummy yummy"` keys can cause unstable reconciliation once the list changes.
   - Recommended action: add a stable `id` field to work items and use it as the key.

4. `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` both exist, but `package-lock.json` is not in sync with `package.json`.
   - Current impact: `npm ci` fails, while Yarn install works.
   - Recommended action: choose one package manager. Given current state, keep Yarn and remove or regenerate `package-lock.json`.

5. Production build fails on this Windows environment with Node 20.12.2 due to a Next worker memory crash.
   - Verified: `corepack yarn lint` passes with warnings only, and `tsc --noEmit` passes.
   - Current impact: deploy/build pipeline may fail depending on environment memory and worker behavior.
   - Recommended action: reproduce on CI or WSL/Linux, then consider reducing worker pressure, upgrading Next, or isolating large image/static processing paths.

6. Several components contain unused imports or state setters.
   - Examples: `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx` has state setters that are never used, and other components have historical imports.
   - Current impact: noise during maintenance and harder code review.
   - Recommended action: run cleanup after the current content pass, keeping behavior unchanged.

### Verification

- `corepack yarn lint`: passed with existing `<img>` warnings in `components/Footer.tsx`.
- `node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`: passed.
- `corepack yarn build`: failed with `Fatal process out of memory: Zone` from Next/Jest worker.

### Next Review Angle

- Review responsive layout risks after Korean copy expansion.
- Check About/Work pages for content consistency with AI developer positioning.
- Identify low-risk cleanup commits that can be separated from visual/content changes.

## 2026-05-25 03:00 KST - Review 2

### Scope

- Korean portfolio copy quality after AI developer positioning change
- Encoding safety for Korean source text
- Verification-oriented portfolio narrative
- Fast syntax-level validation after copy changes

### Findings

1. The first AI developer copy was too generic and sounded like "AI로 빠르게 만든다" rather than "AI 결과를 책임 있게 검증한다."
   - Current impact: the portfolio positioning did not clearly differentiate the developer's strength.
   - Action taken: revised the main copy toward evaluation, evidence, failure detection, repeatable validation, and reliability automation.

2. Korean text in source files is vulnerable to mojibake during PowerShell-based edits.
   - Current impact: previous Korean copy became unreadable in `app/layout.tsx`, `components/main/MainWrapper.tsx`, and `components/Footer.tsx`.
   - Action taken: rewrote the affected copy blocks and re-saved touched files as UTF-8.
   - Action taken: added an `.editorconfig` with `charset = utf-8` and LF line endings.
   - Recommended action: avoid ad hoc shell text replacement for Korean copy.

3. The homepage now has a stronger technical narrative, but the About and Work pages still use older generic AI/developer wording.
   - Current impact: users may see a strong verification-focused homepage, then inconsistent supporting pages.
   - Recommended action: update `components/about/AboutWrapper.tsx` and `components/works/WorkWrapper.tsx` around the same "검증하는 AI 개발자" positioning.

4. The build toolchain still has intermittent Node/V8 `Zone` memory failures on Windows.
   - Current impact: `next lint` and `next build` are not reliable gates in this local environment.
   - Recommended action: verify in a clean Linux/CI environment or WSL, then decide whether this is environment-specific or a Next/SWC dependency issue.

### Verification

- `node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`: passed.
- Mojibake marker search for known broken Korean byte patterns: no matches in `app`, `components`, or `PEER_REVIEW.md`.
- `corepack yarn lint`: failed this run with Node/V8 `Fatal process out of memory: Zone`.
- `corepack yarn build`: failed this run with Node/V8 `Fatal process out of memory: Zone`.

### Next Review Angle

- Make About/Work pages support the new verification-focused positioning.
- Add encoding/tooling guardrails so Korean content edits do not regress.
- Separate visual copy changes from code cleanup in future commits.
